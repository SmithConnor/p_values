# Hypothesis Testing

A statistical hypothesis test is a test to determine a possible conclusion between two different hypotheses.

`$$H_{0}: \text{Null Hypothesis}$$`
`$$H_{1}: \text{Alternative Hypothesis}$$`

The hypothesis test can be used to produce a p-value.

--

A p-value is the probability of obtaining results which equal to or are more extreme than the observed results (Under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct `\(H_{0}\)`). `$$Pr(X \ge x | H_{0}).$$`

---

# Common thought process i.e. Scientific Method

The logic behind scientific process is quite straight forward.

--

- Observe some kind of phenomenon. (A causes B)
--

- Generate a hypothesis to describe the mechanism behind the phenomenon. (What links A and B?)
--

- Collect data. (Information about A and B)
--

- Analyze the data. (Find whether there is evidence for a link between A and B)
--


Unfortunately, the use and interpretation of p-values causes many problems.

# p-hacking

The misuse of data analysis to find statistically significant results.

- 

Example: [https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

--

# Reasons not to p-hack

- All results are important.

- Creates an idealized view of analysis i.e. you will always be correct.

# How not to p-hack

- Preregistration of a study.
--

- Avoid continuous observation.
--

- Correct for multiple testing.
---

### Hypothesising after the results are known.


--

This terminology is based more in psychology but conveys the same message.

--

- Include post hoc hypotheses as if they were asked at the start.

- Excluding initial hypotheses that did not fit the desired result.

--

### Why is is bad?

--

- Results are always confirmed.

--

- Prevents knowledge of results that already have evidence that does not support the hypothesis.

--

- Results are not reproducible.

--

- Results are not generalisable to the population of interest.

---

# The world is black and white

The results were “plain as day”, recalls Motyl, a psychology PhD student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Data from a study of nearly 2,000 people seemed to show that political moderates saw shades of grey more accurately than did either left-wing or right-wing extremists. “The hypothesis was sexy,” he says, “and the data provided clear support.” The P value, a common index for the strength of evidence, was 0.01 — usually interpreted as 'very significant'. Publication in a high-impact journal seemed within Motyl's grasp.



But then reality intervened. Sensitive to controversies over reproducibility, Motyl and his adviser, Brian Nosek, decided to replicate the study......

# (Mis)interpretation of p-values

# Knowledge Test

Which of the following statements are incorrect?

- When `\(\textbf{p = 0.14}\)` there is a `\(\textbf{0.14}\)` probability that `\(H_{0}\)` (the Null Hypothesis) is true.

--

- When `\(\textbf{p = 0.14}\)` there is a `\(1 - 0.14 = \textbf{0.86}\)` probability that `\(H_{1}\)` (the Alternative Hypothesis) is true.

--

- A p-value of `\(\textbf{p = 0.07}\)` means there is no effect or relationship present ( `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` ).

--

- A p-value of `\(\textbf{p = 0.04}\)` means there is definitely an important scientific reason for the result ( `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` ).

---

# Solution

- When `\(\textbf{p = 0.14}\)` there is a `\(\textbf{0.14}\)` probability that `\(H_{0}\)` (the Null Hypothesis) is true.
- When `\(\textbf{p = 0.14}\)` there is a `\(1 - 0.14 = \textbf{0.86}\)` probability that `\(H_{1}\)` (the Alternative Hypothesis) is true.

A p-value does not prove that something is true.

--

- A p-value of `\(\textbf{p = 0.07}\)` means there is no effect or relationship present ( `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` ).

There is a difference between something being 'statistically significant' and there being 'no relationship' for a certain effect.

--

- A p-value of `\(\textbf{p = 0.04}\)` means there is definitely an important scientific reason for the result ( `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` ).

Random noise in the data can cause statistical significance i.e. a false positive can occur.

# Common mistakes

---

# The p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

- Are we able to prove whether a statement is true?

Just because a p-value does not provide evidence against the null hypothesis, this does not mean the hypothesis is true.

This remains true for the alternative hypothesis and proving results are false (i.e. a p-value does not show any of this).

---

# The p-value is  the probability that the observed effects were produced by random chance.

- Are we working under the assumption of random chance?

- What does the p-value show the relationship between?

--

We are working under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

So a p-value shows the relationship between the data and the null hypothesis.

---

# The 0.05 significance level is an indicator of scientific importance.

- What value should we choose `\(\alpha\)` to be?

- Does this value imply scientific reason?

--

Although `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` is common practice, this value does not provide any scientific reasoning behind the result. 

If you are after scientific reasoning, more evidence should be collected to verify the result (see earlier example).

---

# The p-value indicates the size or importance of the observed effect.

- Does a small p-value mean an important effect?

--

No, with a larger sample size we require a smaller effect to produce a significant p-value.

More data means more tests. This will then lead to an increased probability of mistakes occuring.

---

# Summary

- 'Statistically significant' does not mean important.

Something as small as recovering from illness 6 minutes faster may be 'statistically significant'.

- A p-value is only part of the process.

A p-value cannot prove if something is true or false.

- The larger the data, the more likely you are to find at least some results which provide `\(p \leq 0.05\)`.

Multiple tests increase the chance of errors.


## Once created, p-value errors may be hard to identify!
